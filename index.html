            <!-- <h1>LGBT Elders Are Worried About Adequate Support As They Age</h1> -->
            <!-- <h2>by K. Dominic McKenzie & Allie Weintraub</h2>
<br>
<p> As New York City’s population ages, the need for LGBT-specific services is increasing for seniors, a recent report by AARP found. </p>
<p> As many as 91 percent of LGBT seniors in the United States are interested in LGBT-friendly housing developments with in-house support and social services for older adults.
  A New York City focused report found four in five indicated that services and programs were “very important.” </p>
<p>“Quote about having support in house” said George Phipps, a resident at the Keith D. Cylar House Residence & Health Center, a service of Housing Works. Founded in 1990,
  Housing Works is a New York City non-profit that provides housing for people living with HIV. </p>
<p>Phipps, 58, is estranged from family, who do not know he is gay and HIV-positive. He said living in the residence has allowed him to find connections with others who share a similar story.</p>

<p>But Housing Works isn’t geared toward the elderly.
  In fact, no LGBT-specific senior residence exists in the city, even though two-thirds of survey respondents voiced a preference for on-site services run by an LGBTQ organization.</p>

<p>Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE) wants to change that. They partnered with the New York City Housing Authority to propose two developments, Crotona Senior Residences in the Bronx and Ingersoll Senior Residences in Brooklyn. Construction on the developments are set to begin this year.
</p>

<p>SAGE has proposed services including case management, exercise programs, social engagement opportunities and meal services. They’ll also coordinate in-home and medical care services, which is especially important for seniors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are six centers across all boroughs that offer non-housing programs specifically for LGBT seniors. Four additional locations provide support for all ages.</p> -->
